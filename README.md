# MVS, and VM Goodies


Tapes are the standard way to exchange files, utilities and information between mainframes. Some mainframe shops are now connected thru the HNET Bitnet II international dial-up network. I also noticed that recently the industry is moving towards a new fad called the "World Wide Web", which is why I now make this colleciton of tools and utiliteis available on Github in this crazy new world of the Internet!

For more information on HNET/Bitnet II, chck out here: http://moshix.dynu.net

this repository includes some very useful utilities for people working with MVS, z/OS, VM/SP and z/VM on real mainframes or emulated ones. It also includes some operating systems or extensions for operating systems.  Most of the topics covered by these programs are covered in my youtube mainframe channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1ajTWGiUtiAv8X-hpBY7w

Here are some of the programs and tools included in this repo:

1. recv390 is a receive command for Linux or Windows. It extracts XMIT files. recv390 is by James Morrison. I made some fixes and 
   somall enhancement to the program. compile simply with gcc -o recv90 recv390.c.


2. SYCPLK.ccdk is a 3390-3 volume (SYSCPK) which incluedes about 10 or 12 compilers for the mainframe, including:

- PLI F compiler
- Cobol compiler from the 60s
- RPG compiler
- PL/360 compiler
- Pascal compiler
- the amazing ASSIST assembler
- Simula compiler
- Basic
- and tons more!

 Simply mount the volume on your system, add it to the VTLST00 member as private, and then extend your JES2 to use the included
 SYS2.PROCLIB on SYSCPK. This proclib has procedures for all the included compilers. The run-time libraries, like SYSC.PLILIB are of course included in the volume. 

 I  tested in on everything from MVS 3.8 to OS390 all the way to z/OS 1.13 and it works beautifully. There is also a version of this volume on 3350 disk image, but OS390 and up don't have support for such old disks anymore. Copying stuff over to a 3390 disk isn't trivial because of the blocking required by certain compiler libraries. In short, there is a need for this volume. 

3. sort.jcl is a sort job which stresses a Tk4 MVS 3.8 by creating millions of random records and then using IBM sort to sort them. 

4. the amazing standalone operating system for S/360 from Prof Madnick's seminal book on operating system. I also include the assembly output. 

5. my .vimrc file for VIM. It color highlights correctly JCl and assembler for S/370. 

6. my PL/I implementation of the N x N queens problem

7. an output separator for Hercules printers

8. The usefuljcl/ directory contains very useful JCL jobs which you will use on adaily basis as a MVS or z/OS SYSPROG

9. a calculator for ideal blocksize given a DASD type and a logical record length, written by me in Go language. It's called blocksize.go and I also inlude a Linux 64bit binary

10. the PC370 source code for the simply amazing S370 assembler which runs in MS-DOS. 

11. Lots of JCL and source code files which I use in my moshix mainframe channel vidoes

12. Some JCL for Cobol and VSAM on z/OS

13. My REXX programs for both z/OS and MVS 3.8 to get information from the operating system, such as online users, IPL time etc. 

14. SMF reporting tools

15. Rexx panel programs for TSO

16. Panel/Rexx programs for TSO

17. LOGREC cleaning JCL

18. Creating users on TSO (Patata approach, which works very nicely)

19. Sort jobs example with IBM Sort (Iceman)

21. my .X3270pro file (UPDATE: NOW WITH TURBOPASCAL theme)

22. my RSCS config file for HNET

23. ISPF Panel Rexx examples

24. JSON code for interaction between Golang and DB2

25. my c3270pro file with keybindings for z/VM, VM/370, MVS and z/OS

26. A z/VM machine load information utility

27. A working copy of the original CHRIMAS EXEC (OR CHRISTMA EXEC) worm from 1988

28. A payroll report source code in MVT Cobol with test data and the JES2 output listing

29. VM/370 extensions

30. The TELPAR operating system for EDA (Electronic Design Automation) and 
 ATG (Automatic Test Generation) of Stanford University

31. a disassembler

32.  Sample parameterhandling jobs, 

33.  submit bash script for z/OS or MVS workflow in vim

35.  3270 extended attribute codes

36.  a link to an archive with a fully installed MVS 3.8 TK4- Update 8 with ISPF, BREXX, NJE38 compiler bug fixes etc. 

37.  some very cool VM/370 add-ons

37.  and more...much, much more




Enjoy!
