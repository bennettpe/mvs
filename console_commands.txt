Console commands
================


**Managing the 3270 console**
k a,ref shows areas on operator console
k a,none – removes “out of line area” from console.  You may need to do k e,d to remove the area first
k a,14 makes the area 14 lines deep
k a,6,6 makes two areas A and B, can then use D A,L,L=B for to display the command  D A,L in window B
Some commands,  eg display commands comes up in a “out of line” frame at bottom of the screen

k d,f scroll forward, sometimes pf8 does this. Check with d pfk
k e,d remove the bottom “out of line display” area
Screen

k q clear the backlog of queues messages
k e clear the scrolling messages
k s,ref display the current settings
k s,del=rd have message scroll off the top automatically
k s,del=n stop messages scrolling off the top
k e,n  remove nth message from the top of the screen – useful of the messages do not scroll.
d pfk
k n,PFk=(001,CMD=’d a,l;d ts,l’) sets the pf key to the command strings separated by ;
PA1 retrieve previous command
If you lose the console

v 700,offline
V CN(L700),ONLINE

TASID
TASID is a “monitor” tool developed internally within IBM to monitor activity on a z/OS system. It is displayed in ISPF on TSO.     It displays IPL info, storage usage, address space usage etc.   Think of unix “top” function.

Note that some options may not  operate correctly on all z/OS systems. Download it from IBM here.

  
**USS Unix services**
ls -T file display file tag, ASCII, EBCDIC etc ISO8859-1 is ASCII, code page, codepage
chtag -p display/change file tag info
chtag -t -c ISO8859-1 filename  change the filename to be oeditable
whence name like which name, tells you where a command came from eg whence oedit is /bin/oedit

cp copy files
find
find . -name *.sh all files of type .sh in the current directory
find . -mtime +1 all files in the current directory modified older than one day ago
find . -mtime -1 all files in the current directory modified less than one day ago
find . -mtime 4 all files in the current directory modified exactly 4 days ago
find . -ctime 3 all files with attributes change exactly 3 day ago
find . -atime -1 all files in the current directory accessed less than one day ago. Though I do not see how this works in a R/O file system across IPLs
find . -mtime -1 -a -type f files modified less than 1 day ago, and it is a regular file. -type d for dictionary
mkdir 
mkdir -p and the intermediate directories
pax another way of packing files to make them portable. It keeps meta data.
